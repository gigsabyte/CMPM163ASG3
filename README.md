Experiments with particle systems, noise functions and using sound data.


Features:

- Falling leaves, fire and smoke particles that make use of noise functions

- Tree that sways based on overall music volume

- Animated deer that speeds up and slows down in time to percussion

- Original music by me, dankly trap remix'd by Fernando "dÎ¼sk" Zamora
